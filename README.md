# Comparison between Simulation and Physical Tests 🦖🌍

Welcome to our repository! Here you will find the code and results of an exciting project that compares simulations in ns-3 with physical tests in a real-world environment. 🦕

This project focuses on analyzing the performance of the TCP protocol by sending up to 4 GB of data in both a simulated environment and a physical one.
Just like in the ns-3 simulation, the same volume of data was sent during the physical tests, allowing for effective comparison of the results. 📊✨

Physical Tests 🦕

In addition to the simulation in ns-3, several physical tests were conducted, documented in the d_ecolab file. These tests validate the results obtained in the 
simulation and observe how traffic behaves under real conditions. 🛠️

The analysis of the collected data will provide valuable insights into network performance under different scenarios.
By comparing the results from the simulations and the physical tests, we can identify similarities and differences that 
will enhance our understanding of the TCP protocol's behavior.

Feel free to explore the code! 🦖💻✨
